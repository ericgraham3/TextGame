## Practicing OOP with a simple text-based RPG

## 2023.12.05
I started this project in October 2023 and have added to it slowly as I've learned more about OOP. My immediate goal is to finalize the user interface using an MVC structure for both the adventure and character creation. Additional cleanup is needed on items generally, and specifically on weapons/inventory in the Warrior and Skeleton classes.
